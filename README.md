## Solutions for the assignments of Stanford's course cs231n
### Notes: I have solved all the assignments available, i.e. from 2017-2023; but Assignment 1 & 2 (which have relatively stayed the same over the years) are in the 2017 format, without Google colab mounts and stuff, but the code and answers remain the same; where as for assignment 3, which has improved vastly to include transformers and SSL, it is the 2021-2023 format using Google colab heavily. Also the 2017 assignment had a part on style transfer which was not there in later assignments, so in the `Style Transfer` folder, it is actually assignment 3 from 2017, but I have removed other notebooks as their equivalents are in the assignment 3 folder. Also I have provided my answers to inline questions. <br>
### Please note the package versions before running the code locally, assignments 1 & 2 have different requirements (I suggest making a new environment with python 3.5.x) from assignment 3.
